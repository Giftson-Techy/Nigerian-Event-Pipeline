🔧 LXML BUILD ERROR - FIXED!
=============================

PROBLEM: lxml==4.9.3 doesn't support Python 3.13.4

✅ SOLUTION APPLIED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. 🔄 UPDATED requirements.txt:
   - Changed: lxml==4.9.3 → lxml>=5.0.0
   - Newer lxml supports Python 3.13

2. 🐍 UPDATED runtime.txt:
   - Changed: python-3.11.5 → python-3.11.9
   - More stable Python version

3. 📤 PUSHED TO GITHUB:
   - Latest commit includes the fixes
   - Render will use updated dependencies

🚀 NOW TRY RENDER DEPLOYMENT AGAIN:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. 🔄 MANUAL DEPLOY:
   - Go to your Render service
   - Click "Manual Deploy"
   - Select "Deploy latest commit"

2. ✅ WATCH FOR SUCCESS:
   Build logs should now show:
   - "Successfully installed lxml>=5.0.0"
   - No more build errors
   - "Build succeeded 😀"

🎯 ALTERNATIVE - FRESH SERVICE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If manual deploy still has issues:

1. 🗑️ DELETE current service
2. 🆕 CREATE new service with:
   - Repository: Nigerian-Event-Pipeline
   - Build: pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Start: python main.py
   - Runtime: Will use python-3.11.9

3. 🔑 ADD ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
   - GOOGLE_API_KEY = AIzaSyCrAbL3wuKwejD3dKuBoL7q3U6oOGEDEDc
   - GOOGLE_CSE_ID = 979f891fa78df44b8
   - PORT = 10000
   - FLASK_HOST = 0.0.0.0

🎉 EXPECTED RESULT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Clean build without lxml errors
✅ All dependencies installed successfully
✅ Nigerian Event Pipeline starts up
✅ Global URL ready for mobile access!

🔧 WHAT WE FIXED:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- lxml compatibility with Python 3.13
- Updated to stable Python 3.11.9
- Requirements.txt now works on all Render environments
- Your Nigerian Event Pipeline is deployment-ready!

🚀 Ready to try Render deployment again!
