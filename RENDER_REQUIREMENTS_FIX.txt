🔍 RENDER CAN'T SEE REQUIREMENTS.TXT - SOLUTION
===============================================

PROBLEM: Render is looking at an older GitHub commit that doesn't have requirements.txt

✅ SOLUTION 1: FORCE RENDER TO UPDATE (EASIEST)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. 🌐 GO TO RENDER DASHBOARD:
   - https://dashboard.render.com
   - Find your "nigerian-events" service

2. 🔄 FORCE NEW DEPLOY:
   - Click on your service
   - Go to "Deploys" tab
   - Click "Manual Deploy"
   - Select "Clear build cache & deploy"
   - Wait for fresh deployment

✅ SOLUTION 2: CHECK RENDER'S BRANCH/COMMIT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. 📋 IN RENDER SERVICE SETTINGS:
   - Go to "Settings" tab
   - Check "Branch" is set to "main"
   - Check "Auto-Deploy" is enabled

2. 🔄 TRIGGER NEW COMMIT:
   We'll make a small change to force update

✅ SOLUTION 3: CREATE FRESH SERVICE (GUARANTEED)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. 🗑️ DELETE OLD SERVICE:
   - In Render dashboard
   - Delete "nigerian-events" service

2. 🆕 CREATE NEW SERVICE:
   - "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Connect "Nigerian-Event-Pipeline" repo
   - NOW it will see the latest files!

3. ⚙️ CONFIGURE:
   - Name: nigerian-events-fixed
   - Build: pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Start: python main.py
   - Add environment variables

🎯 WHY THIS HAPPENS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- Render caches the repository state
- When you first connected, requirements.txt wasn't there
- Render is still looking at that old state
- Need to force it to see the updated repository

🚀 QUICK FIX - TRIGGER NEW COMMIT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Let's make a tiny change to force GitHub update:
