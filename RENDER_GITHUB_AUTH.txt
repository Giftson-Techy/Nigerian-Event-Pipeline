   - This gives Render permission to see your repositories

2. 🔐 CHOOSE PERMISSIONS:
   - Render will ask for repository access
   - You can choose:
     📂 "All repositories" (easiest)
     📂 "Selected repositories" → choose "Nigerian-Event-Pipeline"

3. ✅ CONFIRM AUTHORIZATION:
   - Click "Install" or "Authorize"
   - You'll be redirected back to Render

🎯 AFTER AUTHORIZATION:
